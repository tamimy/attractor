## What is attractor?
attractor is an N-body simulation project. It is meant as practise for physics and programming.

## How can I run attractor?
You need to setup an environment to compile the Rust code. Luckily this is very simple. First make sure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) are installed on your machine.

[Clone](https://github.com/tamimy/attractor/archive/refs/heads/mother.zip) the github directory and and open the folder `attractor/` in a terminal. Now you can run

```bash
cargo run
```
Finally open the notebook and select `Run All` to run all the cells.
