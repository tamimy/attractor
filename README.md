attractor is an N-body simulation project. This is to serve as practise for physics and programming. The number crunching is done by code written in Rust, and Jupyter notebooks are used to explain the theoretical aspect of the code along with visualizations using Python. This is supposed to be as simple possible so as to not confuse myself.


## What is attractor?
attractor is an N-body simulation project. It is meant as practise for physics and programming.

## How can I run attractor?
You need to setup an environment to compile the Rust code. Luckily this is very simple. First make sure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) are installed on your machine.

[Clone](https://github.com/tamimy/attractor/archive/refs/heads/mother.zip) the github directory and and open the folder `attractor/` in a terminal. Now you can run

```bash
cargo run
```
Finally open the notebook and select `Run All` to run all the cells.
